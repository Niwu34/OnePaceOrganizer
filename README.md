# One Pace Renamer

This program renames all One Pace video files to a format that is compatible for both Plex and Jellyfin, and either updates the metadata if running on Plex, or generates metadata files for use with Jellyfin.

These .nfo files for Jellyfin are automatically generated by the program itself. Also, this is not an addon for Plex, and Plex does not need any addons for this to work as this program uses the Plex API to update all of the metadata.

By the end, on your Plex or Jellyfin setup, you should have:

- Posters for the Anime and Season/Arcs automatically set for you
- TV Show, Season/Arc, and Episode metadata automatically set
- All One Pace files renamed to be recognized by Plex

You can also re-run the program when new One Pace releases for quick renaming, and this does not require every single One Pace release ever released in order to function.

Note: Plex support is currently in alpha. It should be stable not before too long.

## Usage

There are two ways you can run this. The first is via the [Releases](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one_pace_renamer/releases) page.

The other is through Python 3.13+, run via these instructions:

```
# First-Time Setup:

$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -U pip setuptools
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install

# To run the program:

$ python src/main.py
```

When the program runs, there will be a wizard to help guide through the process, since this all might seem a lot more complicated than it actually is!

It's recommended that you have a directory all ready to go with all of the video files (`.mkv` or `.mp4`) and can point the program there. It's also recommended that the output directory be the place where your One Pace files will live, e.g. `C:\path\to\Jellyfin\Anime\One Pace` as it'll create season folders inside there.

## Adding Data on Episodes and Seasons

Metadata is provided in YAML format. For episodes, this [README](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one_pace_renamer/tree/main/data/episodes#readme) at the bottom of `data/episodes` gives a bit of information on how to add new files.

If there are new One Pace releases, send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one_pace_renamer/pulls) with the added `.yml` in the `data/episodes` folder.

The following two are used for metadata:

- [One Pace Episode Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HQRMJgu_zArp-sLnvFMDzOyjdsht87eFLECxMK858lA/) for CRC32, Manga Chapters, Anime Episodes
- [One Pace Episode Descriptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0Aa2p5x7NioaH9-u8FyHq6rH3t5s6Sccs8GoC6pHAM/) for descriptions for arcs and episodes

Note that future One Pace releases are allowed to be submitted as well, though if the CRC32 isn't known, it can be submitted in the format `Season_99_Episode_99.yml` where 99 in both the season and episode is replaced with the actual season number and episode number with no leading zeroes. Any future releases will be renamed once the actual video file is out and the CRC32 is known.

For additional data that this program uses:

- [Posters for both One Pace itself and all arcs](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one_pace_renamer/tree/main/data/posters) (`data/posters`)
- [Season/Arc information](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one_pace_renamer/blob/main/data/seasons.yml) (`data/seasons.yml`)
- [One Pace Show information](https://github.com/ladyisatis/one_pace_renamer/blob/main/data/tvshow.yml) (`data/tvshow.yml`)
